This Github is for my android application that i'm building.

It's a tutoring application that brings students and tutors together. Students are able to select the courses they want to improve and are presented with a list of tutors that have signed up for that course. Once the student has found a tutor he/she likes, the user can contact the tutor via e-mail or phone and plan a session.


I'm very new to java/developing at all.
